An application for managing payments for part-time professors involves two roles: the administrator and the professors. The administrator is responsible for adding professors, managing the distribution of modules and training hours among professors, as well as overseeing payment management. Professors have the ability to modify their information, view their assigned modules, and review their payment records.

To deploy the application, place the files in a folder within xampp/htdocs.

To access the application, navigate to localhost/folder_name/login1.php.
